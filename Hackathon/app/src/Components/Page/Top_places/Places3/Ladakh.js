The district houses the Zanskar Mountains, one of the highest mountain ranges in the world, at 7756 metres (25,446 ft), in the south.

The region boasts of a unique climatic condition. Ladakh, one of the highest regions of the world, experiences sub-zero temperatures during winter. Nighttime temperatures remain below -5°C most of the time during winter. Winters remain chilly, with snowfall common between December and February, which happens to be the best time to visit Ladakh if you love the winters.
