    <h3>Mizoram</h3>
    <p>Mizoram, also known as the Land of Blue Mountains and the Land of Lushai Highlanders is an exceptionally beautiful place. Covered with lush green forests, tourism in Mizoram is known for its breathtaking views from cliffs, stunning waterfalls and picturesque villages set amidst seas of morning mist that enfold the hills and peaks in its embrace. Here is our complete Mizoram Travel Guide that will help you to plan a trip to Mizoram. Mizoram runs at its own rhythm. This is what we understood on our week-long trip in Mizoram. Literally tucked in one corner of the country, tourism in Mizoram has not yet seen the rush. Thus the beautiful mountain villages and the verdant valleys beyond Aizawl remains quite a tempting destination for off-the-beaten-track travellers like us. The Mizos are friendly and helpful; they lead their life on their own terms.</p>

    <h3>The land of Lushai Highlanders</h3>
    <p>Mizoram has very interesting folklore about their origin. The majority of Mizo tribes believe that they had originated from Khul, a mythical cave in south China. Most of these beliefs were passed on oral traditions. These tribes then migrated towards Manipur and Assam and Myanmar. Mizo literally means highlanders and so Mizoram is practically the land of the Highlanders. Anthropologically, the Mizos belong to the Mongoloid race and were the original settlers in the Shan state of erstwhile Burma. Two of their tribes, the Lushais and the Hmars migrated to their present land crossing the Tiau River bordering western Burma in the early eighteenth century. After the Indian independence in 1947, Mizoram was originally a part of Assam. Later it became a union territory in 1971 and finally, Mizoram became the 23rd Indian State in 1987.</p>

<h3>
Why should you visit Mizoram?
</h3>
<p>
You should visit Mizoram because tourism in Mizoram is completely unadulterated and off the beaten track. The natural beauty of the state is unparalleled. Verdant rolling hills stretch across the horizon. Different shades of green gradually get toned down towards a bluish tint as you keep looking at them.  No wonder Mizoram is also known as the land of blue mountains. In the early morning, the mists from the valleys envelop the hills and mountains in such a way that it feels like a milky white sea. Mizoram also has a number of lakes and waterfalls. Come down to the valleys and you will see stretches of paddy fields surrounded by small hills.
<br/>
Did you Know? Mizoram has 22 hill ranges of diverse heights.
<br/>
The Mizos have a rich and culture and they are passionately drawn to singing and dances. The festivals are quite colourful and their songs and dances depict their joyful nature. With so many places to visit in Mizoram, I hope you will definitely find your reason to visit this remote state of India.

<h3>Mizoram Tourism | Getting around Mizoram</h3>
<p>Mizoram has a hilly terrain, so some of the roads are not at all good. Mizoram does have a robust sumo service. Almost all the major towns and district headquarters are connected by daily sumos that leave at regular intervals. The villages are also connected by sumo, but their numbers are generally very less. Mizoram is also one of the northeast states where we found that sumos ply also in the night time. And believe me, they are quite safe. We ourselves were a bit sceptical about the night sumo, having known about the treacherous road conditions of the mountains. But believe, the night sumos in Mizoram are quite safe. We had taken night sumo from Champhai to Aizawl and later from Aizawl to Silchar. As far as we had heard, accidents usually do not happen.</p>
